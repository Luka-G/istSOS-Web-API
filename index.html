IstSOS core JavaScript library covers most of the IstSOS WA REST HTTP requests, which means that developers can easily get the observation data from IstSOS and publish it to their own Web site/page. Using this library, developers can go even further into development and implement IstSOS admin functionalities, like service registering, sensor registering, creating new offerings, adding new units of measures etc...</p>

							<p>
								This week, I’ve been indentifying all the admin HTTP requests to the server, that are targeting the istSOS RESTful API. By identifying, I mean writting down:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>URL</li>
								<li>type of request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)</li>
								<li>response data</li>
								<li>request payload</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Also, I’ve started designing the class structure, for the purpose of developing JavaScript core library.
								All of the mentioned work, I’m doing in partnership with a GsoC student Florin-Daniel Cioloboc, who’s working on an Java core library for istSOS and our work overlaps in this section.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="report-text">
							<h4 class="bg-primary">What do you plan on doing next week?</h4>

							<p>
								This week, I've been continuosly working on class structure design for JavaScript core library and also started commiting some code. The was to implement IstSOS, Server and Database classes, but let's say that 90% of it is done.

							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="report-text">
							<h4 class="bg-primary">Are you blocked on anything?</h4>
							<p>Actually, the reason why 90% of mentioned classes were done, is that I was unable to store JSON response object into an outside variable. For the information, I've been using Google Closure library for executing AJAX requests.</p>

							<p>
								This week, I’ve implemented Configuration, Service, Offering, ObservedProperty, DataQuality, UnitOfMeasure and Date classes. Service class is partially implemented, because it depends on other classes that should be implemented soon. Also, I’ve created an html and JavaScript file for testing and I’ve already tested some of the previously implemented classes, but the new ones are about to be tested.<br/>
								Appart from mentioned, I’ve updated OSgeo wiki page with timeline and weekly reports, also you can take a look at README file in my GitHub forked repository, because I’ve started with creating API documentation for the core library I’ve been working on.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="report-text">

								This week, in consultance with my mentors, I've reduced number of tools that I've had planned to implement, because they seem irrelevant. Also, I changed approach a little bit, so I needed to start over with implementation. New plan is to develop small library for creating widgets. So far, I have implemented istsos.widget.Widget base class and partially istsos.widget.Map class. Code can be checked <a href="https://github.com/WebPractice-LukaG/web-widget-creator" target="_blank">here</a>.
							</p>
						</div>

								This week, I finished with the implementation of Map creator tool. Of course, further improvements will be made along the way, but the main functionality is covered and tested. I also started with the implementation of a Box creator tool. Also I've been updating and fixing the istsos core library with some changes regarding the getObservations method and compatibility issues with Internet Explorer 11. All variations of getObservations method can now pass multiple procedures as parameter. Code can be checked at following links:

Also, I'm kinda slow with the documentation updates, so I will be focusing on that also starting tomorrow.

								This week, I almost finished the implementation of Box widget creator tool. Generated box widget rellies on Bootstrap and this is not good, because it forces the user to import Bootsrap to his Web page, so, design part needs to be rearranged. Functionality is fully implemented, except the "decision making", when it comes to choosing the right icon to represent selected observed properties.  This will be solved in consultance with the mentors.<br/>
								I also spent a lot of time, familiarizing with the VistSOS data visualization framework and I'm still working on a plan how to integrate it into my project. So far, I thought of general concept of how the user input form is going to look like, how am I going to connect it to the istsos.widget.Chart class and what parts of VistSOS project I'm going to use.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="report-text">
							<h4 class="bg-primary">What do you plan on doing next week?</h4>

								Next week, I plan to finish the Map creator tool (minor changes related to displaying of a time format, will be introduced), Box creator tool with pure CSS styling and I plan to have first version of Chart creator tool. In order to implement Chart creator tool, I still need to explore the capabilities of VistSOS in consultance with the student, who's working on that project. Hopefully in the period from August 7th to August 14th, I will be having first version of istSOS Web API and will be dealing with fixing the minor issues, completing the documentation etc.

							<h4 class="bg-primary">What did you get done this week?</h4>
							<p>
								This week, I implemented the form for generating chart widgets, there is still  "build" method left to implement, but that will be quick, because whole logic is about dynamically creating the <code>&#60;istsos-chart&#62;</code> element. This implementation rellies on Vistsos - Data visualization framework and I prepared it for possible updates. If any change comes up, the only thing that needs to be updated is chart-types specification file and application does all the rest.

							<h4 class="bg-primary">What do you plan on doing next week?</h4>
							<p>
								Next week, I plan to refine the code,put some comments  and update the documentation. Also there are some issues with the event handling, which I'm going to solve in consultance with the mentors

							<h4 class="bg-primary">The state of the project as it was before your GSoC?</h4>
							<p>
								Before my GSoC, IstSOS data couldn't be published on the Web, without hard coding from scratch. Developers would have had to learn about WA REST interface, to implement those requests in order to get the data, to define how they want to publish that data, etc...
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="report-text">
							<h4 class="bg-primary">The addition that your project brought to the software?</h4>
							<p>
								With istSOS Web API, developers can use powerfull istSOS core JavaScript library that covers most of the WA REST HTTP requests. Also, developers now have istSOS Web widget creator , at their disposal. This is an application that uses istSOS core Javascript library and offers the set of widget creator tools:
								<ul>
									<li> Map - developers can easily build map widgets, that show sensor locations, last observation and date&time of the last observation for each sensor</li>
									<li>Box - developers can easily build boxes, that contain sensor name, date&time of the last observation, and last observation values for each observed property related to selected sensor</li>
									<li>Chart - integrated framework from the project - VistSOS - Data visualization framework. Developers can easily configure and build several types of interactive charts, that represent observation data in selected time span.</li>
								</ul>
